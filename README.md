# github-username-data-aggregator
Scrapes GitHub username data using BeautifulSoup4 and formats the scraped data into a CSV document

Scrapes, with a custom throttle, GitHub username data using BeautifulSoup4 and formats the scraped data into a CSV document.
DISCLAIMER: I strongly recommend to use GitHub's API instead of manually scraping the username data using this Python file. Remember to respect GitHub's crawl delay guidelines, as per GitHub's robots.txt file, in order to not overload the website with requests!
